# Workleap's reusable GitHub Actions repository

This repository contains centralized workflows that are re-used across the organization's repositories.

# Renovate daily workflow

This repository also hosts the daily [Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/) workflow for the whole [workleap GitHub organization](https://github.com/workleap/).

Repositories **must opt-in** to Renovate automated dependency updates by providing their own configuration file. Repositories without a Renovate configuration file will be ignored.

# Reusable workflows

## Semgrep

This workflow runs the semgrep security scanner against the given repo.
